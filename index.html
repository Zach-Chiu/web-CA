		A coffee bean is a seed from the Coffea plant and the source for coffee.It is the pit inside the red  <br>
	or purple fruit.This fruit is often referred to as a coffee cherry, and like the cherry, it is a fruit  <br>
	with a pit.	</p>
	
	<p class = coffee-bean2>
		Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their <br>
	 resemblance to true beans. The fruits most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. <br>
	 A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, called a "peaberry". </p>
